# Ensure you have 'container_fqdn: false', otherwise it feels like
# cheating.
#
# The nameserver uses [Unbound]() and always have IP address set to
# '{subnet}.254'.
#
# The 'zonedb' is a list of files/directories which will be copied
# to a flat directory, files with the same name will be overwritten.
#
# Setting 'autozone: true' will create a zone database including all
# hosts in the cluster. The zone created supports dynamic update
# through nsupdate. To also generate the reverse 'in-addr.arpa.' zone
# set 'autoptr: true'.
#
# Note that either 'autozone' is set, or a 'zonedb' must be provided.
#
# DNSSEC, DoT and DoH are planed, but still not implemented.
#
# Whenever 'external_dns' is used '--dns {subnet}.254' is applied to
# all hosts in the cluster.
