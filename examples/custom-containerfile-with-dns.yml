# FreeIPA and ansbile-freeipa depend heavily on correct DNS configuration,
# and when using most of public available containers /etc/resolv.conf is
# configured is a way that may not work for FreeIPA deployment.
#
# This is the reason the provided containerfiles in ipalab-config use some
# helper scripts to circunvent these issues and limitations.
#
# Another option, that is more dependent on the user environment, is to
# use '--dns' with podman CLI or 'dns' in the compose file.
#
# The 'dns' option can be set for each deployment; or can be set for
# each individual node. The inner scopes will override the broader
# settings.
#
# Note that as the first server will usually need to have access outside
# of the container network, the 'dns' setting for the deployment will be
# ignored, and it will only apply to it if explicitly defined.
